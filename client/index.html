          <h1>IMUduino examples</h1>
          <p>Here are a bunch of examples of using the IMUduino with javascript
          to give you a taste of what you can do with this device</p>
          <p>Each section below is associated with a specific sketch, either from
          the official IMUduino github, or from my sketches folder.  A link will
          be provided for each section.</p>
          <p>To use a sample, load the appropriate sketch, run
          <strong>npm config set imuduino-3js:type [name of section]</strong>, restart the server, and then click on
          the link for the sample.</p>
